Jiawei Du is currently a second-year postgraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). He is an active researcher at the [Multimedia Information Retrieval Lab](http://mirlab.org/) (MIRLab), supervised by [Prof. Jyh-Shing Roger Jang](http://mirlab.org/jang/) in the areas of speech processing and machine learning. He obtained his B.S. degree from the Department of Information and Telecommunications Engineering at [Ming Chuan University](http://web2.mcu.edu.tw/en/), under the mentorship of [Prof. Shu-Yin Chiang](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shu-Yin-Chiang) in Robotics.

Jiawei's research is centered on speech technology and its applications, including Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV), Neural Audio Codec, and Audio Deepfake Detection and Localization. These research directions aim to assist in distinguishing truth from falsehood in the era of AIGC proliferation. He is currently focusing on Audio-Visual Anti-Spoofing, as deceptions are particularly compelling in multi-modal scenarios.

Jiawei is actively seeking global internships in speech processing and machine learning. He is also planning to pursue a Ph.D. degree starting in Fall 2025 or Spring 2026. If you have any internship vacancies or suitable Ph.D. positions, please feel free to contact him.
