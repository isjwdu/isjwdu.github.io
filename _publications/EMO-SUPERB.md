SER relies on classification models and cannot process valuable natural language labels. We leverage ChatGPT to relabel the natural language labels, as shown in Figure 1, achieving consistent improvement across all experimental settings. 

80.77% of SER papers yield results that cannot be reproduced. We develop an easy-to-use and high-performance codebase to enhance open-source initiatives. 

Official data partitioning guidelines are lacking in most SER datasets, leading to data leakage issues. We release partition files addressing this issue.
